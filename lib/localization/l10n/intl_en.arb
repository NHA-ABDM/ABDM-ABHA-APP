I understand that UIDAI will share my e-KYC details, or response of “Yes” with NHA upon successful authentication. I have been duly informed about the option of using other IDs apart from Aadhaar; however, I consciously choose to use Aadhaar number for the purpose of availing benefits across the NDHE.
